      I'm a first-year Computer Science student, and I'm really into programming 
      and working on different tech projects. I also spend a lot of time with 3D design,
      using Onshape to create models and dive deeper into design.
      I’m always looking for new challenges and ways to grow my skills in both coding and design!
